# CppSim
A physics engine in C++

This is a project with the aim of gaining knowledge about simulators or physics engines with the goal of being able to build and control some simple mechanisms like a (double) pendulum on a cart.

The project is still in its early stages... stay tuned!

### Build Instructions (Ubuntu)
Install the required packages and build the project:
```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake libsdl2-dev
